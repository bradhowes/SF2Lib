/**
 Representation of an envelope with various stages that have their own timing characteristics and levels.

 The SF2 spec implies that the envelopes are to be thought of as representing an attenuation value
 where the peak is 0 dB attenuation and the floor is -100dB (regardless of bit count of the samples).
 This implementation instead treats the envelope as a value from 0.0 (floor) to 1.0 (peak).
 */

/// Stages defined in the SF2 2.01 spec (except for the `idle` state).

/**
 Generator of values for the SF2 volume/modulation envelopes. An SF2 envelope contains 6 stages:

 - Delay -- number of samples to delay the beginning of the attack stage
 - Attack -- number of samples to ramp up from 0.0 to 1.0 in a exponential way
 - Hold -- number of samples to hold the envelope at 1.0 before entering the decay stage.
 - Decay -- number of samples to lower the envelope from 1.0 to the sustain level in a linear descent
 - Sustain -- a stage that lasts as long as a note is held down
 - Release -- number of samples to go from sustain level to ~0 in a linear descent

 The envelope will remain in the idle state until `gate(true)` is invoked. It will remain in the sustain stage until
 `gate(false)` is invoked at which point it will enter the `release` stage. Although the stages above are listed in the
 order in which they are performed, any stage will transition to the `release` stage upon a `gate(false)`
 call. Note that the envelope value is only changed by increments found in the Stage instances, and there is no forced
 adjustment of the value when transitioning from stage to stage. For instance, for an envelope value to traverse the
 entire delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain collection of stages, the generator gate must be `true` for all of the
 sample counts found in each stage up until the sustain stage (which effectively holds an unlimited sample count value).
 When the gate becomes `false` due to a key release, the envelope enters the release stage and the value begins to
 become smaller as it approaches 0.0. However, if the generator gate becomes `false` before the envelope enters the
 `sustain` stage, it could be at a level higher than the configured sustain level when it reaches the `release` stage.
 The decrement of the release stage is the (negative) slope of the line going from 1.0 to 0.0 over the duration of the
 release stage, so the envelope will have the same trailing edge slope regardless of what value the envelope has
 reached before entering the `release` stage.

 This behavior should also protect the rendering engine from discontinuities that might result when manually setting
 the envelope value to a fixed value when changing states.

 The more traditional ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope can be achieved by setting the delay and hold
 durations to zero.
