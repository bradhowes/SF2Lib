/**
 Representation of an envelope with various stages that have their own timing characteristics and levels.

 The SF2 spec implies that the envelopes are to be thought of as representing an attenuation value
 where the peak is 0 dB attenuation and the floor is -100dB (regardless of bit count of the samples).
 This implementation instead treats the envelope as a value from 0.0 (floor) to 1.0 (peak).
 */
namespace SF2::Render::Envelope {

/**
 Generator of values for the SF2 volume/filter envelopes. An SF2 envelope contains 6 stages:

 - Delay -- number of samples to delay the beginning of the attack stage
 - Attack -- number of samples to ramp up from 0.0 to 1.0 in a exponential way
 - Hold -- number of samples to hold the envelope at 1.0 before entering the decay stage.
 - Decay -- number of samples to lower the envelope from 1.0 to the sustain level in a linear descent
 - Sustain -- a stage that lasts as long as a note is held down
 - Release -- number of samples to go from sustain level to ~0 in a linear descent

 The envelope will remain in the idle state until `gate(true)` is invoked. It will remain in the sustain stage until
 `gate(false)` is invoked at which point it will enter the `release` stage. Although the stages above are listed in the
 order in which they are performed, any stage will transition to the `release` stage upon a `gate(false)`
 call.

 The more traditional ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope can be achieved by setting the delay and hold
 durations to zero.
