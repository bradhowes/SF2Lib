/**
 Implementation of a low-frequency triangular oscillator.

 By design, this LFO emits bipolar values from -1.0 to 1.0 in
 order to be useful in SF2 processing. One can obtain unipolar values via the DSP::bipolarToUnipolar method.
 An LFO can be configured to delay oscillating for N samples. During that time it will emit 0.0. After the optional
 delay setting, the LFO will start emitting the positive edge ascending edge of the waveform, starting at 0.0, in order
 to smoothly transition from a paused LFO into a running one. This is by design and per SF2 spec.
