 Interpolatable index into a NormalizedSampleSource. Maintains two counters, an integral one (`size_t`) and a partial
 one (`Float`) that indicates how close the index is to a sample index. These two values are then used by other
 routines to fetch the appropriate samples and interpolate over them.

 Updates to the index honor loops in the sample stream if allowed. The index can also signal when it has reached the
 end of the sample stream via its `finished` method.
