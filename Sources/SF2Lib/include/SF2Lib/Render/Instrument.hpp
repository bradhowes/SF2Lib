 Representation of an `instrument` in an SF2 file. An instrument is made up of one or more zones, where a zone is
 defined as a collection of generators and modulators that apply for a particular MIDI key value and/or velocity.
 All instrument zone generators except the very first must end with generator index #53 `sampleID` which indicates
 which `SampleBuffer` to use to render audio. If the first zone of an instrument does not end with a `sampleID`
 generator, then it is considered to be the one and only `global` zone, with its generators/modulators applied to all
 other zones unless a zone has its own definition.
