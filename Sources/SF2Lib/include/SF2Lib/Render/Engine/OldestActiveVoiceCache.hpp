/**
 Least-recently used cache of active voices. All operations on the cache are O(1) but each entry in the
 cache is 3x the size of the value being held (`size_t`) + an iterator that points to the entry in the cache.
 Internally, the cache consists of a linked list which keeps the voices ordered by their time of activation. For fast
 removal within the linked list, there is a separate vector of iterators that points to each entry in the linked list.
 Changes to a std::list do not invalidate iterators that point to other nodes besides the one being added or removed.

 This vector is indexed by the voice index that is unique to each voice.

 The internal std::list uses a custom allocator that guarantees there are no allocations/frees during changes in the
 std::list container.
