 Least-recently used collection of voice indices. All operations on the cache are O(1) and there is no memory allocation
 after construction. Internally, the cache consists of a linked list which keeps the voices ordered by their time of
 activation, newest at `begin())` to oldest just before `end()`. For fast removal within the linked list, there is a
 separate vector of iterators that points to each entry in the linked list. Changes to a `std::list` do not invalidate
 iterators that point to other nodes besides the one being added or removed.
