/**
 Engine that generates audio from SF2 files due to incoming MIDI signals. Maintains a collection of voices created at
 construction time. A Voice generates samples based on the configuration it is given from a Preset.

 Note that a major design goal is to keep from allocating any memory while a render thread is running and generating
 samples. This also implies that all communications with the engine while rendering (eg MIDI events or real-time
 parameter changes should be done with care. For the AUv3 use-case, this is handled by the `EventProcessor` base class
 and the AUv3 API. MIDI events and parameter changes are scheduled using dedicated APIs and the render thread sees them
 during a render request.
