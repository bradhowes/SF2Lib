 Represents a preset that knows how to emit sounds for MIDI events when it is active.

 A preset is made up of a collection of zones, where each zone defines a MIDI key and velocity range that it applies to
 and an instrument that determines the sound to produce. Note that zones can overlap, so one MIDI key event can cause
 multiple instruments to play, each of which will require its own Voice instance to render.
