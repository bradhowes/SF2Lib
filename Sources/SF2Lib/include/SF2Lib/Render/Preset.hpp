 Representation of a `preset` in an SF2 file. A preset is made up of one or more zones, where a zone is defined as a
 collection of generators and modulators that apply for a particular MIDI key number and/or velocity.

 All preset zone generators except for the very first must end with generator index #41 `instrument` which indicates
 which `Instrument` to use for the basis for audio rendering. If the first zone of a preset does not end with an
 `instrument` generator, then it is considered to be the one and only `global` preset zone, with its generators and
 modulators applied to all other zones unless a zone has its own definition.

 Note that preset zones can overlap, so one MIDI key event can cause multiple instruments to play, each of which will
 require its own Voice instance to render.
